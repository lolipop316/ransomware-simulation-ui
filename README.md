# Ransomware Simulation UI

A simple HTML and CSS project built for Mission Ready Diploma (Mission 1).  
Purpose was to simulates a ransomware lock screen to kinda show how front-end design can represent cybersecurity concepts.

For Mission 2, I expanded my original HTML/CSS project by adding **JavaScript** to make it interactive.  
The new script creates a message element dynamically, reads user input, and checks it against fake valid keys and an authorization code.  
If both match, it displays a green success message; if not, a red error message appears all without reloading the page.  
This update introduced functions, event listeners, DOM manipulation, and conditional logic, turning the project from a static page into a working simulation.

## Notes
This is a front-end-only simulation for learning purposes.  
No real encryption or backend code included 😂  
Now includes JavaScript from **Mission 2** to make the page interactive and display real-time feedback.
